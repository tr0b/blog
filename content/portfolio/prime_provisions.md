## Introduction

Late 2022, the whole world was still struggling with the pandemic. Lockdowns were just getting lifted (in some parts) around the world, but the sense of doubt that predated over those months, about a return to normality, was something that crept in my mind.

Coupled with a job that kept me fully isolated from the client's needs - relayed over by the Product team - never in my mind did the thought cross to me, that I would have the opportunity to work on such an arduous side-gig.

## First Contact

I was approached by a wonderful client; he wanted me to build a web store, and a landing page for his new, yacht provisioning service.

Thus, during the following weeks, we met constantly (along with my brother, who's remarkable creative design skills gave birth to a slick, user friendly interface) to launch this project.

## Final Product

The result? The creation of [Prime Provision's web page](https://primeprovisions.cr), along with a [web store](https://store.primeprovisions.cr) that covered all the client's needs.

## A short Post-mortem
This was my very first "side-gig" and serious, successful attempt at freelancing. It showed me that I was able to take on new client facing challenges and work independently, self-owned, guided only by the client's desires; of course, this didn't arrive in the form of cushy, short workdays but rather with lots of late night meetings to make sure that I wasn't deviating from the original vision; to share progress to the client and assure them that their solution would be great.
