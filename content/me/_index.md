Born in the year 2000, I grew up in Costa Rica and have been through a lot of adventures in this short time. My wish is to live a thousand years and beyond. Ever since I was a child I longed leaving this planet and roaming the stars. I'm confident this will be happening soon enough.

Since a very early age I dug my claws onto computers, and quickly I learned that I could provide instructions to them, in order to fulfill my wishes.

For the most part I lived a very lonely childhood, so my outlets were doing sports [swimming & martial arts] or playing video games. I also played the piano and would love to get better at it, and I also like to sing.

I try to maintain an active and healthy lifestyle, as I'm required to put tenfold a normal person's effort in order to live without any worries, especially with my bones and muscles.

Surrounded by machines from a very early age, I naturally ventured into different realms in order to entertain myself, and taught myself some programming concepts along the way.

For the meanwhile, I work as a Senior Software Engineer, while also looking for new adventures to write down before my thousandth birthday.
