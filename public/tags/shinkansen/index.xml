&lt;p>This entry will be rather short. Originally I had plans to expand more on Osaka&amp;rsquo;s famous attractions, such as the &lt;em>Tsutenkaku&lt;/em>, but I had an unfortunate incident in the afternoon after my trip to the Osaka Castle. I was extremely sweaty from walking tens of thousands of footsteps across Osaka, disorganized from the sun showering the city with its golden heat, forming a tepid atmosphere like no other. My home country isn&amp;rsquo;t as humid or as warm as Osaka, changing weathers then, wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to work to my benefit, along with long walking distances to go from one place to another, something that Japan is famous for.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After some good 40 minutes of walking, I finally arrived at the outskirts of the Osaka castle. From the outskirts, you can appreciate the fortress, the aquatic trench reflecting the sun rays and hosting a variety of submarine guards patrolling the perimeter looking (a.k.a fish). To access the castle, walking all the way through the gravy road and then pass the bridge where the aquatic friends live.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Renowned for it&amp;rsquo;s Winter Siege and Summer war battles that took place back in the Shogunate period of the 1610&amp;rsquo;s, when Japan wasn&amp;rsquo;t an united country, but rather a splintered region of battling shogunates, the castle also holds an important portion of history surrounding the second great unifier of Japan: &lt;strong>Toyotomi Hideyoshi&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the outside I had to stand in a very long queue to access the castle, I was a bit impatient since I wanted to eat something and then head over to the Tsutenkaku, and coupled with my feet screaming at me to finally sit down, I made the mistake of buying the &lt;em>Osaka Amazing Day Pass&lt;/em> while standing on the line. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t smart at all since I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to fully take advantage of the other day pass attractions due to the little incident I will mention later in the article, but at least I was able to run straight into the day pass line and save me some precious time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re interested on visiting the castle, make sure you have very comfy shoes and your calves are strong, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of stairs ( the Castle has a total of 7 floors) so you will be going up and down a lot, it&amp;rsquo;s best to not rest a lot or else you will feel even more tired after you finally stand up, like me =).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The castle&amp;rsquo;s first level holds famous Osaka&amp;rsquo;s samurai artifacts from the Edo period (If I recall correctly), there&amp;rsquo;s also something that caught my attention that I also noticed on my trip to Kyoto, about the Tiger rooms/Tiger drawings; basically there were no tigers in Japan back then, so how were artists able to draw tigers at all? You can find out the answer and more about this in my Kyoto article.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This floor contains some lovely portraits illustrating the famous Osaka Summer war and the Winter Siege. What I admired the most is the level of detail the painting goes into, thousands of soldiers, cavalry, artillery from each side, battle fiercely for controlling the Castle, a decisive victory was later awarded to the Tokugawa shogunate, sealing the fate of the Toyotomi clan and putting an end to the siege of Osaka. There&amp;rsquo;s an informative wall containing all sorts of details about each general of the battle, which is helpful for understanding more about each faction participating in the siege.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
I skipped all the way to the roof afterward. There&amp;rsquo;s an incredible view of Osaka from here, and it was completely worth it destroying my feet soles to feel the wind brace my entire body as I stared deep into the city and its mountains. My hair was pulling tricks on me with the wind and made me look like a maniac, and I wished there was a barber shop on the roof so that I observe the scenery more clearly, oh well..&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Remember how I told you a little incident happened while I was visiting Osaka? Well, the incident was just me arriving at the hotel to take a shower before heading out to see &lt;em>Tsutenkaku&lt;/em> tower. I made mistake of showering with warm water and sitting in the tub relaxing for a good 40 minutes, I immediately felt tired and so I decided to lay over in my bed and browse the internet with my phone. Finally I decided to take a nap and I could&amp;rsquo;ve sworn I set the alarm to 40 minutes from now. It was 5pm and I closed my eyes. When I opened them again, it was 11PM, I wasted 5 hours sleeping and now I had little time any place, except for Osaka&amp;rsquo;s bar/night life district; &lt;strong>Shinsaibashisuji&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this district, you can find a lot of bars with various thematics. In all honesty, I&amp;rsquo;m remaining sober for the time being, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you&amp;rsquo;re barred from entering them, you can easily order tasty food (ramen, miso, and a lot of dishes which I have difficulty pronouncing, let alone typing into the article)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some interesting facts about this district: It has a latin american themed bar, &lt;a href="ghttps://www.google.com/maps/place/LUNA&amp;#43;SKY&amp;#43;International&amp;#43;Latin&amp;#43;Bar/@34.6744362,135.4995199,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x6000e7007c4c24b5:0xa2e55fb9faa857e8!8m2!3d34.6744318!4d135.5020948!16s%2Fg%2F11y2h6ztq1?entry=ttu&amp;amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDkwNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D" >
LUNA SKY International Bar&lt;/a>, so if you&amp;rsquo;re a fan of reggaeton and salsa or simply want to experience LATAM in Japan, this is the bar for you. There are also nightclubs and a lot of &amp;ldquo;servers&amp;rdquo; who will keep offering you a &amp;ldquo;night of fun&amp;rdquo; with their selection of girls. Do not pay attention to them and they will go away on their own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Youths can be observed walking on the boulevard, some are drunk, some are bold enough to say neutral stuff in front of you (I remember a girl there stared at me and said &lt;em>Kokku-jin&lt;/em> or something else which I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand immediately)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Osaka is a very dynamic, modern city, full of things and cultural wonders that make a great impact on the spectator. From it&amp;rsquo;s castles to its shrines, to its vibrant night life, I loved Osaka and so far consider it my favorite city, but sadly I need to leave to explore other places. I&amp;rsquo;ll move to the APA hotel right next to Gion station in Fukuoka, where I&amp;rsquo;ll explore several places such as the Fukuoka Zoo &amp;amp; Botanical Garden, the Wonder World Summer park, the Flower Museum in Uminonakamichi which I failed spectacularly to see, and the outskirts of Marine World.

&lt;p>Kyoto holds a special place in my heart. It is Japan&amp;rsquo;s cultural capital, a place packed with millenia of history, and a place that gained the appreciation of the United States military upper echelons that helped it narrowly avoid nuclear destruction at the end of World War II, the same cannot be said about Hiroshima, the city that took its place and received the first atomic beating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kyoto was also the original capital of Japan for almost a thousand years. From 794 to 1868, when the Meiji Restoration occurred in the late 19th century, bringing all of Japan together once and for all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Arriving at Kyoto from either Tokyo or Osaka is fairly easy, one only needs to take the corresponding local trains to a station that offers Shinkansen to Kyoto. In fact, from Osaka to Kyoto, you can take either the Hankyu Kyoto line, or the Tokaido-Sanyo line, both from the Shin Osaka Station.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Apparently this is a famous boulevard in Kyoto and for a good reason, it holds a lot of antique/traditional stores that sell all sorts of items, from books and poems to traditional food and more modern comestibles. But the main reason I liked this boulevard is that it leads to another Buddhist temple and Swordsmanship museum that features katanas from the great Oda and his disciples. Particularly, I loved the explanation on how samurai swords were crafted. Sadly I couldn&amp;rsquo;t take any pictures from either place since pictures are restricted, but I can assure you it&amp;rsquo;s worthy to visit as a stop before Nijo Castle.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After some good 40 minutes of walking from Kyoto Shijakusho (you don&amp;rsquo;t need to walk that long, this was my mistake), Nijo&amp;rsquo;s castle entrance was just around the corner. The castle appears to be restored, but still I liked the aesthetic from the outside. To access Nijo Castle&amp;rsquo;s interior, you need to purchase a ticket in the entrance outside. It&amp;rsquo;s no more than $5 and it&amp;rsquo;s an amazing experience all around. You can walk around all interior rooms and find great explanations about each of them, such as the famous tiger rooms.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 class="relative group">About the Tiger Rooms

&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Something that caught my attention, were those rooms covered with paintings of the yellow stripped beasts with eerie eyes; Like a demon possessing the mammal, they stared at you with supernatural intensity and stood out as personal preferences from the painters portraying those giant cats. Well apparently the reason these tigers were painted so differently was due to the fact that Japan back then, didn&amp;rsquo;t have any tigers. Imagine trying to paint a penguin without never having seen one before except for its two wings, its beak and silhouette. Even if you were the world&amp;rsquo;s greatest painter, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to picture exactly the word penguin, so then you take some inspiration from the chunks of penguin bodies you were provided with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what happened with these tiger room paintings! Since the artists merely had the tiger hides and other products that came from the tiger, they took some creative liberties to bring the yellow felines into life. Quite interesting isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The mind works in mysterious ways, untamed and it will remain an anchor, drowning you.

&lt;p>If you ever find yourself in Japan, you will need to come to terms with it&amp;rsquo;s walking distances from one place to another. Renting a car might not be an option for most nationals (nor would I recommend it, it&amp;rsquo;s always a headache to take care of vehicles that aren&amp;rsquo;t yours) and sometimes the places you may want to visit are far away from the nearest station. This is exactly what happened to me when I was recommended a visit to &lt;em>Kiyomizu-dera&lt;/em>, by a very friendly local, in the ABC-Mart. Originally, I was going to return to Osaka with swollen feet and 5 kilos lighter, from all the sweat I poured over the streets of Kyoto, but, there was something calling me to visit this temple, in hopes of signing off my day in Kyoto, with a spiritual (mis)adventure, despite my legs screaming at me in agony.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Climbing the buddhist temple is no easy task. I had to depart from Kyoto&amp;rsquo;s ABC-Mart - walking - in direction to the monument, and was met with a barrage of &lt;em>extreme-heat temperature&lt;/em> alerts, a phenomenon that&amp;rsquo;s becoming far more frequent and deadly in Japan as Earth keeps suffocating. The view of the inclined slopes leading to the temple hit my soul with the power of a thousand waves. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to continue going, but felt like I couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep going forward. With every step, I felt as if the numbness of my feet crept higher into my body. It&amp;rsquo;s as if it was raining lead on that sunny day, for I felt my whole body heavy, about to fall into the sunset. Almost an hour of agony later, and I finally arrived at the gates of Kiyomizu-dera&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Tall, red, concave tiles adorned the roofs of the &lt;em>pure water temple&lt;/em>, that&amp;rsquo;s the meaning of Kiyomizu-dera in Japanese. Thousands of tourists flooded the entrance, for a moment standing still looking at the wide lenses, the army of cameras immortalized their moments at the shrine in a snap moment. I had a smug grin all of a sudden as I realized my journey in Kyoto was coming to an end, as I headed inside the temple area looking for something. Something that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even aware of, but it kept calling me, perhaps the Buddhist spirits called me inside to explore the elevated lands and its scenery?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I stood amazed at the edge of the hill that gave a sincere view of Kyoto, being swallowed by the sunset, and hastily moved forward before the monks came out to close the temple. I walked all around and down some stairs in the green hills and found the famous blessed water cascade; &lt;em>Otowo-no-taki&lt;/em>, where there are three fountains of holy water, offers its guests the opportunity to take sacred water from one of its cascades. There&amp;rsquo;s a folklore that says drinking from any of these cascades, will bless the person with love, money and success. I sparkled some of it in my hands, specifically the central cascade&amp;rsquo;s water. I didn&amp;rsquo;t drink it though, so who knows if I ended up blessed, but I&amp;rsquo;m confident that it was the case =)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When I had explored all I could of the temple before it closed for the day, I was faced with a final hill to climb to head back to the exit. I&amp;rsquo;ll never forget the happiness I felt after experiencing this precious piece of Kyoto&amp;rsquo;s religious history. The red shrines now behind me, marked a new chapter in my life and made me reflect on a lot of experienced pains I believe, were self=inflicted. A feeling of bliss, knowing that my existence is not just wasting my already frail life force away, in a job I do not like, with limited to no learning, permeated my whole body. Despite my body shutting down on me and praying for a break, atop of this hill I saw myself, and so I took the last steps to receive my reward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A tiny kiosk with two Japanese fellows, and a sea of fresh, ripe oranges was awaiting me. The slogan of this orange juice stand, I&amp;rsquo;ll carry for all my life, a golden slogan to all my struggles and challenges I&amp;rsquo;ve faced along the way. A nudge that can wake up even the biggest pessimist, from the bluest slumber. A slogan that shall unite all the globe and bring peace to humanity: &lt;em>Life is too short, to say no to Orange juice.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
