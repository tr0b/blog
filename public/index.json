Lockdowns were just getting lifted (in some parts) around the world, but the sense of doubt that predated over those months, about a return to normality, was something that crept in my mind.\nCoupled with a job that kept me fully isolated from the client\u0026rsquo;s needs - relayed over by the Product team - never in my mind did the thought cross to me, that I would have the opportunity to work on such an arduous side-gig.\nFirst Contact # I was approached by a wonderful client; he wanted me to build a web store, and a landing page for his new, yacht provisioning service.\nThus, during the following weeks, we met constantly (along with my brother, who\u0026rsquo;s remarkable creative design skills gave birth to a slick, user friendly interface) to launch this project.\nFinal Product # The result? The creation of Prime Provision\u0026rsquo;s web page, along with a web store that covered all the client\u0026rsquo;s needs.\nA short Post-mortem # This was my very first \u0026ldquo;side-gig\u0026rdquo; and serious, successful attempt at freelancing. It showed me that I was able to take on new client facing challenges and work independently, self-owned, guided only by the client\u0026rsquo;s desires; of course, this didn\u0026rsquo;t arrive in the form of cushy, short workdays but rather with lots of late night meetings to make sure that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t deviating from the original vision; to share progress to the client and assure them that their solution would be great.\nReferences # Prime provisions web page -\u0026gt; https://primeprovisions.cr/\nPrime provisions web store -\u0026gt; https://store.primeprovisions.cr\n","date":"27 January 2024","permalink":"/portfolio/prime_provisions/","section":"Portfolio","summary":"I created a web store and landing page for Prime Provisions.","title":"Prime Provisions"},{"content":"","date":"27 January 2024","permalink":"/tags/store/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"store"},{"content":"","date":"27 January 2024","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 January 2024","permalink":"/tags/welcome/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"welcome"},{"content":"","date":"27 January 2024","permalink":"/tags/wordpress/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"wordpress"},{"content":"Born in the year 2000, I grew up in Costa Rica and have been through a lot of adventures in this short time. My wish is to live a thousand years and beyond. Ever since I was a child I longed leaving this planet and roaming the stars. I\u0026rsquo;m confident this will be happening soon enough.\nSince a very early age I dug my claws onto computers, and quickly I learned that I could provide instructions to them, in order to fulfill my wishes.\nFor the most part I lived a very lonely childhood, so my outlets were doing sports [swimming \u0026amp; martial arts] or playing video games. I also played the piano and would love to get better at it, and I also like to sing.\nI try to maintain an active and healthy lifestyle, as I\u0026rsquo;m required to put tenfold a normal person\u0026rsquo;s effort in order to live without any worries, especially with my bones and muscles.\nSurrounded by machines from a very early age, I naturally ventured into different realms in order to entertain myself, and taught myself some programming concepts along the way.\nFor the meanwhile, I work as a Senior Software Engineer, while also looking for new adventures to write down before my thousandth birthday.\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/me/","section":"About Me","summary":"Born in the year 2000, I grew up in Costa Rica and have been through a lot of adventures in this short time.","title":"About Me"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series"}]
